          I have a first class honors Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
          the Waterford Institute of Technology. I started my career
          as a Software Engineer at AML HQ, where I worked on the Software
          Development team. I worked my way up to senior full stack developer. I
          have experience working with small-scale distributed systems, and I'm
          passionate about building high-quality software.

          On the frontend, I harness the power of Angular to craft captivating
          user interfaces that seamlessly blend aesthetics with functionality.
          With a keen eye for design principles and user experience, I ensure
          that every pixel serves a purpose, delivering intuitive and visually
          stunning applications.
          <br /><br />
          On the backend, I orchestrate the magic using .NET Core, leveraging
          its robust framework to build scalable APIs and backend systems.
          Whether it's architecting complex databases, implementing business
          logic, or optimizing performance, I employ best practices and design
          patterns to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the backend
          infrastructure.
